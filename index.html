    <div class="column">Hi My name is Jalyn Campbell and this is my Portfolio page.... it is a work in progress</div>

    <div class="column">Funny Story! - My instructor for the class was a very kind guy. He gave us breaks during class, the odd number problems in the book so we could use the index in the back to complete the homework, he even curved our test grades like a 180 degree half circle. One day i decided to go to the tutors office, i checked in with the tutor and followed him to a classroom. He pointed to a seat next to an older gentlemen, told me to wait and that he would be there soon. I sat in the seat ready to learn but the older gentlemen in the seat next to me was my teacher.  </div>

    <div class="column">My expierence with Coding is very minimal and even less as a developer. I took a course called 'Introduction to Python' and i can say that i enjoyed it. To mention the picture of a rave (above) one of my afterCovid bucket list items is to experience one of this magnitude.</div>
